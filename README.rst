Daybed
######

Daybed is a form-validation and data-storage API.

It is a way to create definitions (models) and to do validation on some
incoming data using these definitions.

Why ?
=====

You can do a lot of things with this kind of service, so these use-cases are
only some of the possibilities we would like to offer.

Maybe do you know Google forms? That's a service letting you design a form and
exposing it to end users, so then you can access the results.

That's working pretty well but nothing there is done in the open. Google now
has all your data ;) In addition to that, the APIs to access this data are not
that funny, you can't interact with them without dealing with rows and cellsâ€¦
which probably isn't what you want.

As a data geek and librist, I don't think that google forms is a reasonable
choice.

**Daybed** tries to solve this very problem by providing a REST API able to do
validation for you, depending on some rules you defined. Oh, and of course it
is a free software, so you can modify it if you want / need.

Okay, what does it looks like, then?
====================================

Daybed is basically a REST interface to create models, edit them and publish
data that complies to these models.

The basic need is to send model definitions to an API, to then send data
which validates against the specified model definitions.

In term of API access, it means something like this, let's push a model
definition to daybed::

    SCHEMA = {
        name: "My super event",
        description: "",
        blah: "toto",
        fields: [
            {
                type: "string",
                name: "title",
                description: "blah",
            },
            {
                name: "category",
                type: "enum",
                description: "blah",
                choices: ('sport', 'culture')
            },
        ],
    }

    > curl -X PUT /definition/events/ -d SCHEMA
    < 200 OK + TOKEN

If you want to update the schema, you need to add the "token" you received
during the creation of the model definition, in a particular header::

    > curl -X PUT /events/?token=<yourtoken> -d SCHEMA
    < 200 OK + TOKEN (the same one)

We can also retrieve the definition of the model::

    > HTTP GET /events
    < {
        "title": "My super event"
        "description": "",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "title",
                "type": "string",
                "description": "blah",
            },
            {
                "name": "category",
                "type": "enum",
                "description": "blah",
                "choices": ('sport', 'culture')
            },
        ],
    }


Now, what you want is to push some data on the API::

    > HTTP POST /events/
    > DATA = {title: 'djangocong', category: 'geeks'}
    < HTTP 400 'geeks' is not one of 'culture or sports'

Here, the validation failed, let's try again::

    > HTTP POST /events/
    > DATA = {title: 'djangocong', category: 'culture'}
    < 200 + UUID of the created event

The record is inserted in the db, let's get all the records::

    > HTTP GET /events/
    > Accept: application/json
    < 200 OK
    < DATA = [{title: 'djangocong', category: 'culture'}]

Or individual records::

    > HTTP GET /events/
    > Accept: application/json
    < 200 OK
    < DATA = {title: 'djangocong', category: 'culture'}

Hacking daybed
--------------

Daybed comes with a Makefile to simplify your life when developing. To install
your virtual environment and get started, you need to type::

    make install

Then, running the test suite is a good way to check that everything is going
well, and is well installed. You can run them with `make tests`.

Once everything is okay, you can run the server with `make serve`.
